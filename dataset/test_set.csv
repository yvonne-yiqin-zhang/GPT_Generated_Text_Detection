"vitamin e is a group of eight fat soluble compounds that include four tocopherols and four tocotrienols. vitamin e deficiency, which is rare and usually due to an underlying problem with digesting dietary fat rather than from a diet low in vitamin e, can cause nerve problems. vitamin e is a fat-soluble antioxidant which may help protect cell membranes from reactive oxygen species. worldwide, government organizations recommend adults consume in the range of 3 to 15 mg per day. as of 2016, consumption was below recommendations according to a worldwide summary of more than one hundred studies that reported a median dietary intake of 6.2 mg per day for alpha-tocopherol. research with alpha-tocopherol as a dietary supplement, with daily amounts as high as 2,000 mg per day, has had mixed results. population studies suggested that people who consumed foods with more vitamin e, or who chose on their own to consume a vitamin e dietary supplement, had lower incidence of cardiovascular diseases, cancer, dementia, and other diseases, but placebo-controlled clinical trials could not always replicate these findings. as of 2017, vitamin e continues to be a topic of active clinical research. there is no clinical evidence that use of vitamin e skincare products are effective. both natural and synthetic tocopherols are subject to oxidation, and so in dietary supplements are esterified, creating tocopheryl acetate for stability purposes.",0

"with physical damage or disease suffered by an organism, healing involves the repair of living tissue(s), organs and the biological system as a whole and resumption of (normal) functioning. medicine includes the process by which the cell(s) in the body regenerate and repair to reduce the size of a damaged or necrotic area and replace it with new living tissue. the replacement can happen in two ways: by regeneration in which the necrotic cells are replaced by new cells that form ""like"" tissue as was originally there; or by repair in which injured tissue is replaced with scar tissue. most organs will heal using a mixture of both mechanisms. within surgery healing is more often referred to as recovery, and postoperative recovery has historically been viewed simply as restitution of function and readiness for discharge. more recently, postoperative recovery has been described as an energy‐requiring process to decrease physical symptoms, reach a level of emotional well‐being, regain functions, and re‐establish activities",0

"acanthochondria cornuta is a species of parasitic worm in the family acanthocephali. it is found in the amazon basin of brazil and peru.  acanthochondria cornuta is a small species of parasitic worm, measuring 2-3 cm in length, that lives in the gut of the giant otter, lontra canadensis. the worm was first described from specimens collected in the brasília area of brazil, but has since been found in a wider range of habitats around the amazon basin, including rivers, lakes, and wetlands.  acanthochondria cornuta is a facultative anaerobe that grows best in environments with high levels of oxygen availability. the worm feeds on bacteria and other small invertebrates that live in the gut of its host, and excretes a digestive fluid that contains bacteria and enzymes that digest the host's food. this process allows the parasite to absorb nutrients directly from its host's bloodstream, bypassing the digestive system entirely.",1

"figure-ground contrast, in the context of mapmaking, is the difference between the shapes and sizes of the features depicted on a map and the spaces around them. the term generally applies to maps of real or imaginary landscapes, but can also be used for maps of abstract concepts.  figure-ground contrast is an important consideration in mapmaking because it affects how viewers interact with a map. for instance, if most of the features on a map are large and well-defined, viewers may feel overwhelmed and lose their sense of orientation. if, on the other hand, most features are small and subtle, viewers may be more likely to notice and appreciate them.  in cartography, figure-ground contrast is often achieved through the use of scale. large features are typically drawn at a larger scale than smaller features, in order to make them more noticeable. conversely, smaller features are typically drawn at a smaller scale than larger features, in order to preserve their visibility.  figure-ground contrast is also important for portraying information on a map. for instance, if a map contains a lot of information about one specific area, it may be difficult to see if that information is balanced among the various features on the map. by contrasting large areas with small areas, cartographers can help to improve legibility.",1

"in finnish folklore, all places and things, and also human beings, have a haltija (a genius, guardian spirit) of their own.  one such haltija is called etiäinen—an image, doppelgänger, or just an impression that goes ahead of a person, doing things the person in question later does. for example, people waiting at home might hear the door close or even see a shadow or a silhouette, only to realize that no one has yet arrived. etiäinen can also refer to some kind of a feeling that something is going to happen. sometimes it could, for example, warn of a bad year coming. in modern finnish, the term has detached from its shamanistic origins and refers to premonition. unlike clairvoyance, divination, and similar practices, etiäiset (plural) are spontaneous and can't be induced. quite the opposite, they may be unwanted and cause anxiety, like ghosts. etiäiset need not be too dramatic and may concern everyday events, although ones related to e.g. deaths are common. as these phenomena are still reported today, they can be considered a living tradition, as a way to explain the psychological experience of premonition.",0

"in economics, the edgeworth conjecture is the idea, named after francis ysidro edgeworth, that the core of an economy shrinks to the set of walrasian equilibria as the number of agents increases to infinity. the core of an economy is a concept from cooperative game theory defined as the set of feasible allocations in an economy that cannot be improved upon by subset of the set of the economy's consumers (a coalition). for general equilibrium economies typically the core is non-empty (there is at least one feasible allocation) but also ""large"" in the sense that there may be a continuum of feasible allocations that satisfy the requirements. the conjecture basically states that if the number of agents is also ""large"" then the only allocations in the core are precisely what a competitive market would produce. as such, the conjecture is seen as providing some game-theoretic foundations for the usual assumption in general equilibrium theory of price taking agents. in particular, it means that in a ""large"" economy people act as if they were price takers, even though theoretically they have all the power to set prices and renegotiate their trades. hence, the fictitious walrasian auctioneer of general equilibrium, while strictly speaking completely unrealistic, can be seen as a ""short-cut"" to getting the right answer.",0

"adverse possession, sometimes colloquially described as ""squatter's rights"", is a legal principle in the anglo-american common law under which a person who does not have legal title to a piece of property—usually land (real property)—may acquire legal ownership based on continuous possession or occupation of the property without the permission (licence) of its legal owner. the possession by a person is not adverse if they are in possession as a tenant or licensee of the legal owner. in general, a property owner has the right to recover possession of their property from unauthorised possessors through legal action such as ejectment. however, in the english common law tradition, courts have long ruled that when someone occupies a piece of property without permission and the property's owner does not exercise their right to recover their property for a significant period of time, not only is the original owner prevented from exercising their right to exclude, but an entirely new title to the property ""springs up"" in the adverse possessor. in effect, the adverse possessor becomes the property's new owner. over time, legislatures have created statutes of limitations that specify the length of time that owners have to recover possession of their property from adverse possessors. in the united states, for example, these time limits vary widely between individual states, ranging from as low as three years to as long as 40 years.",0
