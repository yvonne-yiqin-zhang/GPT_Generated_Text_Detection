"the thrifty gene hypothesis, or gianfranco's hypothesis is an attempt by geneticist james v. neel to explain why certain populations and subpopulations in the modern day are prone to diabetes mellitus type 2. he proposed the hypothesis in 1962 to resolve a fundamental problem: diabetes is clearly a very harmful medical condition, yet it is quite common, and it was already evident to neel that it likely had a strong genetic basis. the problem is to understand how disease with a likely genetic component and with such negative effects may have been favoured by the process of natural selection. neel suggested the resolution to this problem is that genes which predispose to diabetes (called 'thrifty genes') were historically advantageous, but they became detrimental in the modern world. in his words they were ""rendered detrimental by 'progress'"". neel's primary interest was in diabetes, but the idea was soon expanded to encompass obesity as well. thrifty genes are genes which enable individuals to efficiently collect and process food to deposit fat during periods of food abundance in order to provide for periods of food shortage (feast and famine). according to the hypothesis, the 'thrifty' genotype would have been advantageous for hunter-gatherer populations, especially child-bearing women, because it would allow them to fatten more quickly during times of abundance. fatter individuals carrying the thrifty genes would thus better survive times of food scarcity. however, in modern societies with a constant abundance of food, this genotype efficiently prepares individuals for a famine that never comes. the result of this mismatch between the environment in which the brain evolved and the environment of today is widespread chronic obesity and related health problems like diabetes.",0

"value averaging (va), also known as dollar value averaging (dva), is a technique for adding to an investment portfolio that is controversially claimed to provide a greater return than other methods such as dollar cost averaging. with the method, investors add to (or withdraw from) their portfolios in such a way that the portfolio balance reaches a predetermined monthly or quarterly target, regardless of market fluctuations. for example, an investor may want to have a $3600 investment in 36 months. using va, the investor would aim to have a total investment value of $100 at the beginning of the first month, $200 at the beginning of the second month, and so on. having invested $100 at the beginning of the first month, the investment may be worth $101 at the end of that month. in that case, the investor invests a further $99 to reach the second month objective of $200. if at the end of the first month, the investment is worth $205, the investor withdraws $5. the idea of va is that in periods of market decline, the investor contributes more, while in periods of market climb, the investor contributes less. as illustrated in the above example, in contrast to dollar cost averaging, which mandates that a fixed amount of money be invested at each period, the value averaging investor may on occasion be required to withdraw from the portfolio to keep to the program. value averaging was developed by former harvard university professor michael e. edleson.",0

"the genotype of an organism is its complete set of genetic material. genotype can also be used to refer to the alleles or variants an individual carries in a particular gene or genetic location. the number of alleles an individual can have in a specific gene depends on the number of copies of each chromosome found in that species, also referred to as ploidy. in diploid species like humans, two full sets of chromosomes are present, meaning each individual has two alleles for any given gene. if both alleles are the same, the genotype is referred to as homozygous. if the alleles are different, the genotype is referred to as heterozygous. genotype contributes to phenotype, the observable traits and characteristics in an individual or organism. the degree to which genotype affects phenotype depends on the trait. for example, the petal color in a pea plant is exclusively determined by genotype. the petals can be purple or white depending on the alleles present in the pea plant. however, other traits are only partially influenced by genotype. these traits are often called complex traits because they are influenced by additional factors, such as environmental and epigenetic factors. not all individuals with the same genotype look or act the same way because appearance and behavior are modified by environmental and growing conditions. likewise, not all organisms that look alike necessarily have the same genotype.",0

"in population ecology and economics, maximum sustainable yield (msy) is theoretically, the largest yield (or catch) that can be taken from a species' stock over an indefinite period.  fundamental to the notion of sustainable harvest, the concept of msy aims to maintain the population size at the point of maximum growth rate by harvesting the individuals that would normally be added to the population, allowing the population to continue to be productive indefinitely.  under the assumption of logistic growth, resource limitation does not constrain individuals' reproductive rates when populations are small, but because there are few individuals, the overall yield is small.  at intermediate population densities, also represented by half the carrying capacity, individuals are able to breed to their maximum rate.  at this point, called the maximum sustainable yield, there is a surplus of individuals that can be harvested because growth of the population is at its maximum point due to the large number of reproducing individuals.  above this point, density dependent factors increasingly limit breeding until the population reaches carrying capacity.  at this point, there are no surplus individuals to be harvested and yield drops to zero.  the maximum sustainable yield is usually higher than the optimum sustainable yield and maximum economic yield. msy is extensively used for fisheries management. unlike the logistic (schaefer) model, msy has been refined in most modern fisheries models and occurs at around 30% of the unexploited population size. this fraction differs among populations depending on the life history of the species and the age-specific selectivity of the fishing method.",0

"the mid-pleistocene transition (mpt), also known as the mid-pleistocene revolution (mpr), is a fundamental change in the behaviour of glacial cycles during the quaternary glaciations. the transition happened approximately 1.25–0.7 million years ago, in the pleistocene epoch. before the mpt, the glacial cycles were dominated by a 41,000-year periodicity with low-amplitude, thin ice sheets and a linear relationship to the milankovitch forcing from axial tilt. after the mpt there have been strongly asymmetric cycles with long-duration cooling of the climate and build-up of thick ice sheets, followed by a fast change from extreme glacial conditions to a warm interglacial. the cycle lengths have varied, with an average length of approximately 100,000 years. the mid-pleistocene transition was long a problem to explain, as described in the article 100,000-year problem. the mpt can now be reproduced by numerical models that assume a decreasing level of atmospheric carbon dioxide, a high sensitivity to this decrease, and gradual removal of regoliths from northern hemisphere areas subject to glacial processes during the quaternary. the reduction in  may be related to changes in volcanic outgassing, burial of ocean sediments, carbonate weathering or iron fertilization of oceans from glacially induced dust.",0

"a centroblast generally refers to an activated b cell that is enlarged (12–18 micrometer) and is rapidly proliferating in the germinal center of a lymphoid follicle.  they are specifically located in the dark zone of the germinal center. centroblasts form from naive b cells being exposed to follicular dendritic cell cytokines, such as il-6, il-15, 8d6, and baff. stimulation from helper t cells is also required for centroblast development. interaction between cd40 ligand on an activated t helper cell and the b cell cd40 receptor induces centroblasts to express activation-induced cytidine deaminase, leading to somatic hypermutation, allowing the b cell receptor to potentially gain stronger affinity for an antigen. in the absence of fdc and helper t cell stimulation, centroblasts are unable to differentiate and will undergo cd95-mediated apoptosis. morphologically, centroblasts are large lymphoid cells containing a moderate amount of cytoplasm, round to oval vesicular (i.e. containing small fluid-filled sacs) nuclei, vesicular chromatin, and 2–3 small nucleoli often located adjacent to the nuclear membrane. they are derived from b cells. immunoblasts are distinguished from centroblasts by being b cell-derived lymphoid cells that have moderate-to-abundant basophilic cytoplasm and a prominent, centrally located, trapezoid-shaped single nucleolus which often has fine strands of chromatin attached to the nuclear membrane (‘spider legs’). in some cases, immunoblasts can show some morphologic features of plasma cells.",0
"protein numb homolog is a protein that in humans is encoded by the numb gene. the protein encoded by this gene plays a role in the determination of cell fates during development. the encoded protein, whose degradation is induced in a proteasome-dependent manner by mdm2, is a membrane-bound protein that has been shown to associate with eps15, lnx1, and notch1. four transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. the protein numb is coded for by the gene, numb, whose mechanism appears to be evolutionarily conserved. numb has been extensively studied in both invertebrates and mammals, though its function is best understood in drosophila. numb plays a crucial role in asymmetrical cell division during development, allowing for differential cell fate specification in the central and peripheral nervous systems. during neurogenesis, numb localizes to one side of the mother cell such that it is distributed selectively to one daughter cell. this asymmetric division allows a daughter cell containing numb to acquire a different fate than the other daughter cell.",0

"governance is a broader concept than government and also includes the roles played by the community sector and the private sector in managing and planning countries, regions and cities. collaborative governance involves the government, community and private sectors communicating with each other and working together to achieve more than any one sector could achieve on its own. ansell and gash (2008) have explored the conditions required for effective collaborative governance. they say ""the ultimate goal is to develop a contingency approach of collaboration that can highlight conditions under which collaborative governance will be more or less effective as an approach to policy making and public management"" collaborative governance covers both the informal and formal relationships in problem solving and decision-making. conventional government policy processes can be embedded in wider policy processes by facilitating collaboration between the public, private and community sectors. collaborative governance requires three things, namely: support; leadership; and a forum. the support identifies the policy problem to be fixed. the leadership gathers the sectors into a forum. then, the members of the forum collaborate to develop policies, solutions and answers. there are many different forms of collaborative governance as such as consensus building and a collaborative network:  consensus building – ""a process where stakeholders build consensus on actions to address specific public policy problems; community visioning is a process where members of a community build consensus on a descriptions of the community’s desired future and on actions to help make goals for the future a reality."" collaborative network – ""this system is meant to accomplish more alignment among community needs, strategies of service agencies, priority outcomes, and resource allocation. it's also meant to accomplish building social capital; integration of human service delivery; and interconnected strategies for relationship building, learning processes, and measurement and modeling among the participants.""",0

"newfoundland english is a term referring to any of several accents and dialects of atlantic canadian english found in the province of newfoundland and labrador.  most of these differ substantially from the english commonly spoken elsewhere in canada and north america.  many newfoundland dialects are influenced by the dialects of england's  west country, in particular the city of bristol and the counties of cornwall, devon, dorset, wiltshire, hampshire and somerset, while in terms of general cultural heritage, one estimate claims 80 to 85 percent of newfoundland's english heritage came from england's southwest. other newfoundland dialects are influenced by the dialects of ireland's southeastern counties, particularly waterford, wexford, kilkenny and cork. still others blend elements of both and there is also a discernible influence of scottish english. this reflects the fact that  while the scottish came in smaller numbers than the english and irish, they had a large influence on newfoundland society.  the dialects that comprise newfoundland english developed because of newfoundland's history as well as its geography. as to history,  newfoundland was one of the first areas settled by england in north america, beginning in small numbers in the early 17th century before peaking in the early 19th century. newfoundland was a british colony until 1907 when it became an independent dominion within the british empire.  it became a part of canada in 1949 as the last province to join confederation. as to geography,  newfoundland is an island in the north atlantic ocean, separated by the strait of belle isle from labrador, the sparsely populated mainland part of the province. most of the population remained rather isolated on the island, allowing the dialects time to develop independently of those on the north american continent. today, some words from newfoundland english have been adopted through popular culture in other places in canada (especially in ontario and eastward).",0

"kongonaphon is an extinct genus of lagerpetid avemetatarsalians from the middle to late triassic of madagascar. it contains a single species, kongonaphon kely, which is known from a fragmentary partial skeleton. this fossil hails from the late ladinian or early carnian-age ""basal isalo ii beds"". as the first lagerpetid found in africa, kongonaphon extends the range of the family significantly. it possessed a combination of features from various other lagerpetids, but developed particularly long and slender leg bones. kongonaphon is also the first lagerpetid for which fossils of the snout and teeth are known. it was likely an insectivore based on the shape and texture of its teeth. kongonaphon is notable for its minuscule size, even compared to other small early avemetatarsalians. the proportionally elongated femur was only about 4 cm (1.6 inches) long, and the total height of the animal was estimated at around 10 cm (3.9 inches). alongside other miniaturized archosaurs such as scleromochlus, it suggests that avemetatarsalians experienced an abrupt reduction in size early in their evolution. this may explain the poor preservation and scarcity of early and middle triassic avemetatarsalian fossils. a small size also may have helped them exploit a variety of new ecological niches. the most successful avemetatarsalian subgroups, pterosaurs and dinosaurs, may have evolved as a result of this abrupt size reduction. miniaturization has been correlated with the evolution of flight (a defining feature of pterosaurs) and the acquisition of bipedalism (which was utilized by many dinosaurs). it would also lead to poor heat retention, encouraging the evolution of feathers or other filamentous structures.",0

"an image dissector, also called a dissector tube, is a video camera tube in which photocathode emissions create an ""electron image"" which is then scanned to produce an electrical signal representing the visual image. the term may apply specifically to a dissector tube employing magnetic fields to keep the electron image in focus, and an electron multiplier to scan the electrons. dissectors were used only briefly in television systems before being replaced by the much more sensitive iconoscope during the 1930s. operation an image dissector focuses a visual image onto a layer of photosensitive material, such as caesium oxide, which emits negatively charged ""photoelectrons"" proportional to the intensity of the light striking the material. electrostatic deflecting plates or magnetic fields then periodically manipulate the resulting electron image horizontally and vertically before an electron multiplier, or a small aperture leading to a positively charged detector, or anode, in the case of the earliest dissector tubes. the electron multiplier or aperture permits only those electrons emanating from a very small area of the electron image, representing a similarly small area of the visual image. the entire image is scanned several times per second to produce an electrical signal suitably representative of a moving visual image.",0

"a gesture is a form of non-verbal communication or non-vocal communication in which visible bodily actions communicate particular messages, either in place of, or in conjunction with, speech. gestures include movement of the hands, face, or other parts of the body. gestures differ from physical non-verbal communication that does not communicate specific messages, such as purely expressive displays, proxemics, or displays of joint attention. gestures allow individuals to communicate a variety of feelings and thoughts, from contempt and hostility to approval and affection, often together with body language in addition to words when they speak. gesticulation and speech work independently of each other, but join to provide emphasis and meaning. gesture processing takes place in areas of the brain such as broca's and wernicke's areas, which are used by speech and sign language. in fact, language is thought by some scholars to have evolved in homo sapiens from an earlier system consisting of manual gestures. the theory that language evolved from manual gestures, termed gestural theory, dates back to the work of 18th-century philosopher and priest abbé de condillac, and has been revived by contemporary anthropologist gordon w. hewes, in 1973, as part of a discussion on the origin of language.",0

"co-management, also known as community-based management, community-based resource management, or participatory management, is a form of management that seeks to achieve sustainable development by involving the community as an equal partner in the decision-making process. co-management is based on the premise that communities are best placed to know what is best for them and should be involved in all aspects of their own development.  co-management has been practiced in a number of countries around the world, including canada. in canada, co-management has been used to manage natural resources and environmental issues, as well as community economic development. it has been found to be successful in terms of achieving sustainable development goals, such as improving environmental quality and generating economic benefits for the community.  there are a number of reasons why co-management is successful in canada. first, co-management is rooted in the community's culture and history. this means that it is more likely to be accepted by the community and be effective in achieving sustainable development goals. second, co-management is participatory in nature. this means that it allows the community to have a say in how resources are used and benefits are generated. this ensures that the community's needs are taken into account and that they are able to benefit from co-management arrangements. finally, co-management arrangements are flexible and can be adapted to changing circumstances. this means that they can be used to deal with different types of sustainability issues and keep up with changing social and environmental trends.",1
"a ground level enhancement or ground level event (gle), is a special subset of solar particle event where charged particles from the sun have sufficient energy to generate effects which can be measured at the earth's surface. these particles (mostly protons) are accelerated to high energies either within the solar atmosphere or in interplanetary space, with some debate as to the predominant acceleration method. while solar particle events typically involve solar energetic particles at 10–100 mev, gles involve particles with significantly higher energies of >500 mev. description charged particles from the sun generally do not possess the energy required to penetrate the earth's magnetic field or upper atmosphere. however, a small number of solar events produce charged particles which are able to penetrate these layers, causing an air shower. this particle shower reaches ground level, where effects are measured, leading to the name ""ground level enhancement"". these effects are usually measured as elevated levels of neutrons and muons. these events can increase the radiation dose of an individual at sea level or while in an aircraft, though not by enough to significantly increase an individual's lifetime risk of cancer.",0

"scratchpad memory (spm), also known as scratchpad, scratchpad ram or local store in computer terminology, is a high-speed internal memory used for temporary storage of calculations, data, and other work in progress. in reference to a microprocessor (or cpu), scratchpad refers to a special high-speed memory used to hold small items of data for rapid retrieval. it is similar to the usage and size of a scratchpad in life: a pad of paper for preliminary notes or sketches or writings, etc. in some systems it can be considered similar to the l1 cache in that it is the next closest memory to the alu after the processor registers, with explicit instructions to move data to and from main memory, often using dma-based data transfer. in contrast to a system that uses caches, a system with scratchpads is a system with non-uniform memory access (numa) latencies, because the memory access latencies to the different scratchpads and the main memory vary. another difference from a system that employs caches is that a scratchpad commonly does not contain a copy of data that is also stored in the main memory.",0

"the body fat percentage (bfp) of a human or other living being is the total mass of fat divided by total body mass, multiplied by 100; body fat includes essential body fat and storage body fat. essential is necessary to maintain life and reproductive functions. the percentage of essential body fat for women is greater than that for men, due to the demands of childbearing and other hormonal functions. storage body fat consists of fat accumulation in adipose tissue, part of which protects internal organs in the chest and abdomen. a number of methods are available for determining body fat percentage, such as measurement with calipers or through the use of bioelectrical impedance analysis. the body fat percentage is a measure of fitness level, since it is the only body measurement which directly calculates a person's relative body composition without regard to height or weight. the widely used body mass index (bmi) provides a measure that allows the comparison of the adiposity of individuals of different heights and weights. while bmi largely increases as adiposity increases, due to differences in body composition, other indicators of body fat give more accurate results; for example, individuals with greater muscle mass or larger bones will have higher bmis. as such, bmi is a useful indicator of overall fitness for a large group of people, but a poor tool for determining the health of an individual.",0

"an immigration consultant is a person who helps people to emigrate from one country to another country and through legal and documentation process to increase the chances of immigration for study, work, travel or business purpose.  immigration consultants may or may not have legal expertise about immigration laws and visa laws and about procedures for obtaining different types of visas, as the designation is regulated by some, but not all, governments. in the united states, immigration consultants/notaries are not required to have formal immigration law training and are not allowed to answer even the most basic immigration legal questions. doing so would constitute unauthorized practice of law, which is a crime. because of this, many organizations including the central america resource center recommend that all persons seeking immigration assistance completely avoid notaries and immigration consultants and, instead, seek legal advice from a licensed attorney. on the other hand, canada provides certification as a regulated canadian immigration consultant through the immigration consultants of canada regulatory council, and australia provides it through the migration agents registration authority.",0
"the friedman–savage utility function is the utility function postulated in the theory that milton friedman and leonard j. savage put forth in their 1948 paper. they argued that the curvature of an individual's utility function differs based upon the amount of wealth the individual has.  this variably curving utility function would thereby explain why an individual is risk-loving when he has more wealth (e.g., by playing the lottery) and risk-averse when he is poorer (e.g., by buying insurance). the function has been used widely, including in the field of economic history to explain why social gambling did not necessarily mean that society had gone gambling mad. additions four years after the publishing of the original article, harry markowitz, a former student of friedman's, argued that some of the implications of the friedman–savage utility function were paradoxical. specifically, its implication that those at the highest level of income would never take risks. his solution was to relate the curvature of an individual's utility function to increases in wealth. this involved determining an individual's ""normal"" level of income, controlling for utility gains from ""recreational investments"" (the psychological utility gained by the act of gambling), and measuring deviations from the initial level of utility at the ""normal"" level of income.",0

"the respiratory quotient (rq or respiratory coefficient) is a dimensionless number used in calculations of basal metabolic rate (bmr) when estimated from carbon dioxide production. it is calculated from the ratio of carbon dioxide produced by the body to oxygen consumed by the body. such measurements, like measurements of oxygen uptake, are forms of indirect calorimetry. it is measured using a respirometer. the respiratory quotient value indicates which macronutrients are being metabolized, as different energy pathways are used for fats, carbohydrates, and proteins. if metabolism consists solely of lipids, the respiratory quotient is approximately 0.7, for proteins it is approximately 0.8, and for carbohydrates it is 1.0. most of the time, however, energy consumption is composed of both fats and carbohydrates. the approximate respiratory quotient of a mixed diet is 0.8. some of the other factors that may affect the respiratory quotient are energy balance, circulating insulin, and insulin sensitivity. it can be used in the alveolar gas equation.",0

"the order chiroptera, comprising all bats, has evolved the unique mammalian adaptation of flight.  bat wings are modified tetrapod forelimbs.  because bats are mammals, the skeletal structures in their wings are morphologically homologous to the skeletal components found in other tetrapod forelimbs.  through adaptive evolution these structures in bats have undergone many morphological changes, such as webbed digits, elongation of the forelimb, and reduction in bone thickness.  recently, there have been comparative studies of mouse and bat forelimb development to understand the genetic basis of morphological evolution.  consequently, the bat wing is a valuable evo-devo model for studying the evolution of vertebrate limb diversity. comparisons to mouse limb development tetrapod limb development involves many signaling molecules such as fgf, bmp, shh and wnt.  the apical ectodermal ridge is a structure found at the distal most tip which becomes a key signaling center for the developing limb.  surprisingly many of the same signaling pathways known to play a role in tetrapod limb development have been found to play a role in bat forelimb development but the timing, intensity, and spatial gene expression of some orthologous genes have changed.  since mice are also mammals, it is convenient to compare morphology and development of forelimbs between mice and bats; these comparisons may elucidate the genetic basis of adaptive bat wing development.",0

"thermophotonics (often abbreviated as tpx) is a concept for generating usable power from heat which shares some features of thermophotovoltaic (tpv) power generation. thermophotonics was first publicly proposed by solar photovoltaic researcher martin green in 2000.  however, no tpx device is known to have been demonstrated to date, apparently because of the stringent requirement on the emitter efficiency.  a tpx system consists of a light-emitting diode (led) (though other types of emitters are conceivable), a photovoltaic (pv) cell, an optical coupling between the two, and an electronic control circuit. the led is heated to a temperature higher than the pv temperature by an external heat source.  if no power is applied to the led, the system functions much like a very inefficient tpv system, but if a forward bias is applied at some fraction of the bandgap potential, an increased number of electron-hole pairs (ehps) will be thermally excited to the bandgap energy.  these ehps can then recombine radiatively so that the led emits light at a rate higher than the thermal radiation rate (""superthermal"" emission). this light is then delivered to the cooler pv cell over the optical coupling and converted to electricity.",0

"the term thraco-illyrian refers to a hypothesis according to which the daco-thracian and illyrian languages comprise a distinct branch of indo-european. thraco-illyrian is also used as a term merely implying a thracian-illyrian interference,  mixture or sprachbund, or as a shorthand way of saying that it is not determined whether a subject is to be considered as pertaining to thracian or illyrian. downgraded to a geo-linguistic concept, these languages are referred to as paleo-balkan. the linguistical hypothesis was especially current in the early 20th century, but after the 1960s it was seriously called into question. new publications argued that no strong evidence for thraco-illyrian exists, and that the two language-areas show more differences than correspondences (vladimir georgiev, ivan duridanov, eric hamp, et al.), whereas more recent linguists like sorin paliga have argued that based on the available data, illyrian and thracian were mutually intelligible or at very least formed a dialect continuum in a way comparable to czech-slovak and spanish-portuguese or continental scandinavian languages (danish, norwegian and swedish).",0

"graph literacy is the ability to understand information that presented graphically, which are including general knowledge about how to extract information and make inferences from different graphical formats.  although related, graph literacy is distinct from other forms of literacy (e.g., general health literacy or numeracy) in the sense that it relates more specifically to one's ability to obtain meaning from information presented graphically.  it can include the storage of mental representations in long-term memory, knowledge about the properties of different types of formats, and procedures to interpret them.  however, similar to other types of literacy, higher graph literacy is associated with higher education levels and suggests that developing the skills required to interpret graphical information requires knowledge that is acquired through formal education and experience. graph literacy is very important in everyday life: graphs appear throughout the published media, in newspapers and magazines, on tv and on the internet, and are used to provide information for many important decisions including medical, nutritional, financial and political choices.  yet many people can have difficulty understanding even the simplest graphs.  up to one third of the general population lacks the skills needed to understand basic numerical formats (e.g., percentages or ratios) and basic graphic displays (such as bar or pie charts, line graphs, or icon arrays).  while graphical displays can improve understanding and comprehension of quantitative information, such as the risks and benefits of medical treatments, they may not be helpful for everyone.  visual displays may be of greater help to people with low numeracy whereas numbers may be better for people who have poor graph literacy.  determining what type of information displays lead to better comprehension of information, and for whom, is an ongoing topic of research, particularly within the area of risk communication.",0

"conservatism is an aesthetic, cultural, social, and political philosophy, which seeks to promote and to preserve traditional social institutions. the central tenets of conservatism may vary in relation to the status quo of the culture and civilization in which it appears. in western culture, conservatives seek to preserve a range of institutions such as organized religion, parliamentary government, and property rights. adherents of conservatism often oppose progressivism and seek a return to traditional values. the first established use of the term in a political context originated in 1818 with françois-rené de chateaubriand during the period of bourbon restoration that sought to roll back the policies of the french revolution. historically associated with right-wing politics, the term has since been used to describe a wide range of views. there is no single set of policies regarded as conservative because the meaning of conservatism depends on what is considered traditional in a given place and time. conservative thought has varied considerably as it has adapted itself to existing traditions and national cultures. for example, some conservatives advocate for greater government intervention in the economy while others advocate for a more laissez faire free market economic system. thus conservatives from different parts of the world—each upholding their respective traditions—may disagree on a wide range of issues. edmund burke, an 18th-century politician who opposed the french revolution but supported the american revolution, is credited as one of the main theorists of conservatism in the 1790s.",0

"divergent evolution or divergent selection is the accumulation of differences between closely related populations within a species, leading to speciation. divergent evolution is typically exhibited when two populations become separated by a geographic barrier (such as in allopatric or peripatric speciation) and experience different selective pressures that drive adaptations to their new environment. after many generations and continual evolution, the populations become less able to interbreed with one another. the american naturalist j. t. gulick (1832–1923) was the first to use the term ""divergent evolution"", with its use becoming widespread in modern evolutionary literature. classic examples of divergence in nature are the adaptive radiation of the finches of the galapagos or the coloration differences in populations of a species that live in different habitats such as with pocket mice and fence lizards. the term can also be applied in molecular evolution, such as to proteins that derive from homologous genes. both orthologous genes (resulting from a speciation event) and paralogous genes (resulting from gene duplication) can illustrate divergent evolution. through gene duplication, it is possible for divergent evolution to occur between two genes within a species. similarities between species that have diverged are due to their common origin, so such similarities are homologies. in contrast, convergent evolution arises when an adaptation has arisen independently, creating analogous structures such as the wings of birds and of insects.",0

"the fink effect, also known as ""diffusion anoxia"", ""diffusion hypoxia"", or the ""second gas effect"", is a factor that influences the po2 (partial pressure of oxygen) within the pulmonary alveoli. when water-soluble gases such as anesthetic agent n2o (nitrous oxide) are breathed in large quantities they can be dissolved in body fluids rapidly. this leads to a temporary increase in both the concentrations and partial pressures of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the alveoli. the effect is named for bernard raymond fink (1914–2000), whose 1955 paper first explained it. when a patient is recovering from n2o anaesthesia, large quantities of this gas cross from the blood into the alveoli (down its concentration gradient) and so for a short period of time, the o2 and co2 in the alveoli are diluted by this gas. a sufficiently large decrease in the partial pressure of oxygen leads to hypoxia. the decrease in co2 pressure can also potentiate this effect when ventilation is suppressed, leading to potential hypoxaemia. nonetheless, this effect only lasts a couple of minutes and hypoxia can be avoided by increasing the fractional inspired oxygen concentration when recovering from n2o anaesthesia. it is for this reason that entonox, a 50:50 gaseous mixture of nitrous oxide and oxygen, is suitable for use by para-medical staff such as ambulance officers: it provides sufficient nitrous oxide for pain relief with sufficient oxygen to avoid hypoxia.",0

"the nevadan orogeny occurred along the western margin of north america during the middle jurassic to early cretaceous time which is approximately from 155 ma to 145 ma.  throughout the duration of this orogeny there were at least two different kinds of orogenic processes occurring. during the early stages of orogenesis an ""andean type"" continental magmatic arc developed due to subduction of the farallon oceanic plate beneath the north american plate. the latter stages of orogenesis, in contrast, saw multiple oceanic arc terranes accreted onto the western margin of north america in a ""cordilleran type"" accretionary orogen. deformation related to the accretion of these volcanic arc terranes is mostly limited to the western regions of the resulting mountain ranges (klamath mountain range and sierra nevada) and is absent from the eastern regions. in addition, the deformation experienced in these mountain ranges is mostly due to the nevadan orogeny and not other external events such as the more recent sevier and laramide orogenies. it is noted that the klamath mountains and the sierra nevada share similar stratigraphy indicating that they were both formed by the nevadan orogeny. in comparison with other orogenic events, it appears that the nevadan orogeny occurred rather quickly taking only about 10 million years as compared to hundreds of millions of years for other orogenies around the world (ex. trans-hudson orogeny). order of events",0

"in molecular biology, the glutaredoxin 2 family is a family of bacterial glutaredoxins. unlike other glutaredoxins, glutaredoxin 2 (grx2) cannot reduce ribonucleotide reductase. grx2 has significantly higher catalytic activity in the reduction of mixed disulphides with glutathione (gsh) compared with other glutaredoxins. the active site residues (cys9-pro10-tyr11-cys12, in escherichia coli grx2, which are found at the interface between the n- and c-terminal domains are identical to other glutaredoxins, but there is no other similarity between glutaredoxin 2 and other glutaredoxins. grx2 is structurally similar to glutathione-s-transferases (gst), but there is no obvious sequence similarity. the inter-domain contacts are mainly hydrophobic, suggesting that the two domains are unlikely to be stable on their own. both domains are needed for correct folding and activity of grx2. it is thought that the primary function of grx2 is to catalyse reversible glutathionylation of proteins with gsh in cellular redox regulation including the response to oxidative stress. these enzymes are not related to glrx2. references",0

"demining or mine clearance is the process of removing land mines from an area. in military operations, the object is to rapidly clear a path through a minefield, and this is often done with devices such as mine plows and blast waves. by contrast, the goal of humanitarian demining is to remove all of the landmines to a given depth and make the land safe for human use. specially trained dogs are also used to narrow down the search and verify that an area is cleared. mechanical devices such as flails and excavators are sometimes used to clear mines. a great variety of methods for detecting landmines have been studied. these include electromagnetic methods, one of which (ground penetrating radar) has been employed in tandem with metal detectors. acoustic methods can sense the cavity created by mine casings. sensors have been developed to detect vapor leaking from landmines. animals such as rats and mongooses can safely move over a minefield and detect mines, and animals can also be used to screen air samples over potential minefields. bees, plants, and bacteria are also potentially useful. explosives in landmines can also be detected directly using nuclear quadrupole resonance and neutron probes.",0

"reality testing is the psychotherapeutic function by which the objective or real world and one's relationship to it are reflected on and evaluated by the observer. this process of distinguishing the internal world of thoughts and feelings from the external world is a technique commonly used in psychoanalysis and behavior therapy, and was originally devised by sigmund freud. purpose  within psychotherapy and counseling settings, practitioners use reality testing to influence the patient or client to recognize their negative thoughts, evaluate the thoughts logically rather than emotionally, and then determine whether the thoughts are valid (ie: internally consistent and grounded in reality). the focus of reality testing is not necessarily concentrated on the source of the behavior or thought, but rather on the fact that current thoughts are occurring and influencing behaviors in the here-and-now. after undergoing this technique, the patient or client is often able to see that the thoughts he or she has been experiencing are, in fact, not valid or based on reality, and should therefore not be used as the basis for life decisions. reality testing can be used in this way to help facilitate corrective emotional experiences by disconfirming and altering previously held negative or unrealistic expectations in favor of more adaptive functions. psychotherapy methods such as rational emotive behavior therapy and cognitive behavioral therapy rely heavily on the client's ability to frequently self-examine internal thoughts and assess their preceding influence on perceptions, judgments, and behaviors. continual reality testing directed by therapists can help educate clients on how to habitually examine their own thought patterns and behaviors without the ongoing need for a therapist.  constant and prolonged exposure to a multitude of corrective experiences can lead clients to form their own internal and enduring changes in thoughts, expectations, feelings, and behavior. reality testing has also been identified as a curative factor when implemented within a group therapy setting. in group counseling, clients can use the perspectives of other group members as the basis of reality testing and receive instant feedback through group discussions, roleplaying, and other group activities.",0

"snrnps (pronounced ""snurps""), or small nuclear ribonucleoproteins, are rna-protein complexes that combine with unmodified pre-mrna and various other proteins to form a spliceosome, a large rna-protein molecular complex upon which splicing of pre-mrna occurs. the action of snrnps is essential to the removal of introns from pre-mrna, a critical aspect of post-transcriptional modification of rna, occurring only in the nucleus of eukaryotic cells. additionally, u7 snrnp is not involved in splicing at all, as u7 snrnp is responsible for processing the 3′ stem-loop of histone pre-mrna. the two essential components of snrnps are protein molecules and rna. the rna found within each snrnp particle is known as small nuclear rna, or snrna, and is usually about 150 nucleotides in length. the snrna component of the snrnp gives specificity to individual introns by ""recognizing"" the sequences of critical splicing signals at the 5' and 3' ends and branch site of introns. the snrna in snrnps is similar to ribosomal rna in that it directly incorporates both an enzymatic and a structural role.",0

"haloa or alo (ἁλῶα)  was an attic festival, celebrated principally at eleusis, in honour of demeter (δήμητρα, η αλωαίη), protector of the fruits of the earth, of dionysus, god of the grape and of wine, and poseidon (ποσειδώνας ο φυτάλμιος), god of the seashore vegetation. in greek, the word hálōs (ἅλως) from which haloa derives means “threshing-floor” or “garden.” while the general consensus is that it was a festival related to threshing—the process of loosening the edible part of cereal grain after harvest—some scholars disagree and argue that it was instead a gardening festival. haloa focuses mainly on the “first fruits” of the harvest, partly as a grateful acknowledgement for the benefits the husbandmen received, partly as prayer that the next harvest would be plentiful. the festival was also called thalysia or syncomesteria. the festival  haloa took place every year, during the month poseideon (ποσειδέωνας), after the first harvest was over. the festival took place around the threshing floor (αλώνια) at the same time throughout attica. all women were expected to attend this event, but men were almost always excluded. men had a legal and moral expectation to pay for their wives’ expenses in these festivities. the strange timing of the harvest festival—mid-winter—is significant as well. the greeks regarded the festival as sacred to not only demeter but also to dionysus. with the inclusion of dionysus in the festival worship, the date shifted towards the winter as “he possessed himself of the festivals of demeter, took over her threshing-floor and compelled the anomaly of a winter threshing festival.” in many ways, the festival was just as connected, if not more so, with dionysus than with demeter. thus, we see the power and influence of the incoming god and of the importance of wine to greek cult activity. practically, greeks were able to coax out a harvest just early enough to revel with dionysus.",0

"in taxonomy, natrialba is a genus of the halobacteriaceae. the genus consists of many diverse species that can survive extreme environmental niches, especially they are capable to live in the waters saturated or nearly saturated with salt (halophiles). they have certain adaptations to live within their salty environments. for example, their cellular machinery is adapted to high salt concentrations by having charged amino acids on their surfaces, allowing the cell to keep its water molecules around these components. the osmotic pressure and these amino acids help to control the amount of salt within the cell. for instance, n. magadii is an aerobic chemoorganotrophic, dual extremophile requiring alkaline conditions and hypersalinity for optimal growth. those harsh conditions resulted in changed composition of charged amino acids in the proteins (average isoelectric point is only 4.64, whereas other organisms average is 6.5) with almost all proteins being highly acidic. the genome of n. magadii consists of four replicons with a total sequence of 4,443,643 bp and encodes 4,212 putative proteins. the genome analysis identified multiple genes coding putative proteins involved in adaptation to hypersalinity, stress response, glycosylation, and polysaccharide biosynthesis. additionally, proton-driven atp synthase and a variety of putative cytochromes and other proteins required for aerobic respiration and electron transfer had been found. the genome encodes a number of putative proteases/peptidases.",0

"thermophoresis (also thermomigration, thermodiffusion, the soret effect, or the ludwig–soret effect) is a phenomenon observed in mixtures of mobile particles where the different particle types exhibit different responses to the force of a temperature gradient. this phenomenon tends to move light molecules to hot regions and heavy molecules to cold regions. the term thermophoresis most often applies to aerosol mixtures whose mean free path  is comparable to its characteristic length scale , but may also commonly refer to the phenomenon in all phases of matter.  the term soret effect normally applies to liquid mixtures, which behave according to different, less well-understood mechanisms than gaseous mixtures. thermophoresis may not apply to thermomigration in solids, especially multi-phase alloys. thermophoretic force the phenomenon is observed at the scale of one millimeter or less. an example that may be observed by the naked eye with good lighting is when the hot rod of an electric heater is surrounded by tobacco smoke: the smoke goes away from the immediate vicinity of the hot rod. as the small particles of air nearest the hot rod are heated, they create a fast flow away from the rod, down the temperature gradient. they have acquired higher kinetic energy with their higher temperature. when they collide with the large, slower-moving particles of the tobacco smoke they push the latter away from the rod. the force that has pushed the smoke particles away from the rod is an example of a thermophoretic force, as the mean free path of air at ambient conditions is 68 nm  and the characteristic length scales are between 100-1000 nm.",0

"the task system is a system of labor under slavery characteristic in the americas. it is usually regarded as less brutal than other forms of slave labor. the other form, known as the gang system, was harsher.  under this system, each slave is assigned a specific task to complete for the day.  after that task is finished, the slave is then free to do as he or she wishes with the remaining time. the gang systems forced the slaves to work until the owner said they were finished and allowed them almost no freedom. whether plantation owners organized their slaves on the task or gang system had much to do with the type of crops they harvested. tobacco and sugar cultivation was organized into gangs since those crops required considerable processing and supervision. coffee, rice, and pimento were comparatively hardier plants where extensive supervision was unnecessary, leading planters to favor the task system on their plantations. early rice task system evidence suggests that the task system, in some places, included a gender dimension.  the women laborers played a major role in the work force for rice cultivation in south carolina.  this was a division of labor that transferred directly from west african cultures. women were responsible for the planting, weeding, harvesting, threshing, and polishing of the rice crop.  men were responsible for building canals and rice fields, flooding and draining fields, and protecting the crops from animals.",0

"in mathematics, incidence geometry is the study of incidence structures. a geometric structure such as the euclidean plane is a complicated object that involves concepts such as length, angles, continuity, betweenness, and incidence. an incidence structure is what is obtained when all other concepts are removed and all that remains is the data about which points lie on which lines. even with this severe limitation, theorems can be proved and interesting facts emerge concerning this structure. such fundamental results remain valid when additional concepts are added to form a richer geometry. it sometimes happens that authors blur the distinction between a study and the objects of that study, so it is not surprising to find that some authors refer to incidence structures as incidence geometries. incidence structures arise naturally and have been studied in various areas of mathematics. consequently, there are different terminologies to describe these objects. in graph theory they are called hypergraphs, and in combinatorial design theory they are called block designs. besides the difference in terminology, each area approaches the subject differently and is interested in questions about these objects relevant to that discipline. using geometric language, as is done in incidence geometry, shapes the topics and examples that are normally presented. it is, however, possible to translate the results from one discipline into the terminology of another, but this often leads to awkward and convoluted statements that do not appear to be natural outgrowths of the topics. in the examples selected for this article we use only those with a natural geometric flavor.",0

"pressure measurement is the analysis of an applied force by a fluid (liquid or gas) on a surface. pressure is typically measured in units of force per unit of surface area. many techniques have been developed for the measurement of pressure and vacuum. instruments used to measure and display pressure in an integral unit are called pressure meters or pressure gauges or vacuum gauges. a manometer is a good example, as it uses the surface area and weight of a column of liquid to both measure and indicate pressure. likewise, the widely used bourdon gauge is a mechanical device, which both measures and indicates and is probably the best known type of gauge. a vacuum gauge is a pressure gauge used to measure pressures lower than the ambient atmospheric pressure, which is set as the zero point, in negative values (for instance, −15 psig or −760 mmhg equals total vacuum). most gauges measure pressure relative to atmospheric pressure as the zero point, so this form of reading is simply referred to as ""gauge pressure"". however, anything greater than total vacuum is technically a form of pressure. for very accurate readings, especially at very low pressures, a gauge that uses total vacuum as the zero point may be used, giving pressure readings in an absolute scale.",0

"the identity of indiscernibles is an ontological principle that states that there cannot be separate objects or entities that have all their properties in common. that is, entities x and y are identical if every predicate possessed by x is also possessed by y and vice versa. it states that no two distinct things (such as snowflakes) can be exactly alike, but this is intended as a metaphysical principle rather than one of natural science. a related principle is the indiscernibility of identicals, discussed below. a form of the principle is attributed to the german philosopher gottfried wilhelm leibniz. while some think that leibniz's version of the principle is meant to be only the indiscernibility of identicals, others have interpreted it as the conjunction of the identity of indiscernibles and the indiscernibility of identicals (the converse principle). because of its association with leibniz, the indiscernibility of identicals is sometimes known as leibniz's law. it is considered to be one of his great metaphysical principles, the other being the principle of noncontradiction and the principle of sufficient reason (famously been used in his disputes with newton and clarke in the leibniz–clarke correspondence).",0

"in common usage, the mass of an object is often referred to as its weight, though these are in fact different concepts and quantities. in scientific contexts, mass is the amount of ""matter"" in an object (though ""matter"" may be difficult to define), whereas weight is the force exerted on an object by gravity. in other words, an object with a mass of 1.0 kilogram weighs approximately 9.81 newtons on the surface of the earth, which is its mass multiplied by the gravitational field strength. the object's weight is less on mars, where gravity is weaker, and more on saturn, and very small in space when far from any significant source of gravity, but it always has the same mass. objects on the surface of the earth have weight, although sometimes the weight is difficult to measure. an example is a small object floating in water, which does not appear to have weight since it is buoyed by the water; but it is found to have its usual weight when it is added to water in a container which is entirely supported by and weighed on a scale. thus, the ""weightless object"" floating in water actually transfers its weight to the bottom of the container (where the pressure increases). similarly, a balloon has mass but may appear to have no weight or even negative weight, due to buoyancy in air. however the weight of the balloon and the gas inside it has merely been transferred to a large area of the earth's surface, making the weight difficult to measure. the weight of a flying airplane is similarly distributed to the ground, but does not disappear. if the airplane is in level flight, the same weight-force is distributed to the surface of the earth as when the plane was on the runway, but spread over a larger area.",0
